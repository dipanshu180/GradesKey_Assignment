"""1)	Distributed computing vs Centralized System :-

Distributed computing:
•   A system where computing task are spread across servers that communicate to achieve common goal. 
•	If one server fail we use different one.
•	Managing distributed computing is not easy as compare to centralized system.
Centralized System:
•	A system where all the computing data and control are managed by single sever.
•	If the main server fail then entire system goes down.
•	It is easy to manage.

2)	Scaling Vertically vs Horizontally
  Vertical Scaling
•	Increasing the capacity of machine by adding resources like CPU, RAM etc.
Horizontal Scaling:
•	Adding more machine and distributing work across them.

3)	Batch vs Stream processing:
Batch processing:
•	Processing data in large, fixed size chunk at given interval.
Stream processing:
•	Process data as it comes in, no waiting.

4)	Monolithic vs Microservices:
Monolithic:
•	A single, unified application where all components are coupled as a single unit.
•	Failure will affect whole system.
Microservices:
•	An application is broken down into small, independent services, each responsible for a specific business function.
•	Some failures don't affect everything.

5)	Programming language: 
•	Choosing the language according to requirement

#2) You have a huge data set and it is in unsorted order. Which search do you prefer ?

**ANSWER:-**
- We will go with Linear search if there is no preprocessing but if there is preprocessing we will prefer binary search.
